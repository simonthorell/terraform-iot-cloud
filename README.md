# AWS Terraform IoT Cloud

<img src=".assets/terraform.png" alt="Terraform" style="width: 150px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-top: 50px;">

This **IoT system** is designed to collect, process, store, and display temperature and humidity data from an ESP32 IoT device, integrating seamlessly with **AWS** cloud services and a frontend application.

At the core of this project is **Terraform**, which serves as the backbone for Infrastructure As Code **(IaC)**, ensuring that all AWS resources are provisioned and deployed in a consistent, automated, and scalable manner.

---

### Production Environment

In production, the **ESP32** IoT device collects temperature and humidity readings and sends them to **AWS IoT Core** using MQTT.
Upon arrival, IoT Core adds a timestamp to the datapoint. The data is then routed to AWS DynamoDB using IoT Core Rules, where it is stored for further processing and retrieval.

**AWS DynamoDB** serves as the primary database, storing temperature, humidity, and timestamps.

**AWS Lambda** functions power the frontend UI by handling serverless processing and logic. The `iot_data` function retrieves and processes data from the database to deliver the necessary information to the UI, while the `devices` function serve device-status data using AWS IoT-Core Device Shadows.

Both functions are integrated with **AWS API Gateway**, which provides a structured REST API for seamless interaction with external systems and the frontend.

**AWS Amplify** connects the backend to the user-facing frontend and manages user authentication through AWS Cognito. Cognito ensures secure user interactions, while IAM handles permissions across all AWS resources, ensuring a scalable and secure architecture.

---

### Development Environment

The development workflow focuses on three main components:

- **IoT Device Firmware**, written in Rust, collects and transmits data from an ESP32 device.
- **Lambda API**, developed in Go, powers the Lambda functions that provide the frontend with data.
- **Frontend UI**, built with Nuxt.js and Vue, visualizes the data in clear, user-friendly dashboards.

To simplify development, artifacts like the Rust firmware, Go binaries, and frontend assets are compiled, zipped and stored in dedicated S3 buckets. These buckets make components easy to access and deploy. The frontend, hosted on AWS Amplify, uses the API Gateway to display real-time temperature and humidity data from the IoT devices.

This system provides an integrated solution, enabling seamless data flow from IoT devices to the AWS cloud. The data is processed and presented in intuitive dashboards and visualizations, giving users comprehensive and interactive insights.

## Scalability in AWS IoT Cloud

Scalability is a cornerstone of the architecture for any IoT system, especially when dealing with dynamic workloads and potentially massive amounts of incoming data. This IoT system leverages the scalability of AWS services and Terraform's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capabilities to ensure smooth performance and adaptability to growing demands.

#### **Scalability in AWS Services**

1. **AWS IoT Core**  
   AWS IoT Core is built to scale horizontally, handling millions of device connections and processing a high volume of MQTT messages simultaneously. With its serverless nature, it automatically adjusts capacity to match incoming traffic, ensuring low latency and reliable message delivery even as the number of devices increases.

2. **AWS DynamoDB**  
   DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database designed for extreme scalability. Its on-demand capacity mode dynamically adjusts to workload changes, ensuring that the database can handle spikes in data ingestion without manual intervention. Additionally, features like global tables allow replication across multiple regions for high availability and low-latency access worldwide.

3. **AWS Lambda**  
   Lambda's serverless model inherently supports scalability by executing code in response to triggers and automatically allocating compute resources as needed. It ensures that even during peak traffic, functions scale without requiring manual provisioning or management of servers.

4. **AWS API Gateway**  
   API Gateway scales automatically to handle large numbers of concurrent API requests, ensuring consistent performance for the frontend application and external integrations. Rate-limiting and caching features further enhance its ability to handle surges in traffic effectively.

5. **AWS Amplify and Cognito**  
   Amplify simplifies frontend-backend integration and scales alongside the underlying AWS services. Cognito supports millions of users and provides secure authentication with auto-scaling capabilities, ensuring seamless user management as the application grows.

#### **The Role of Terraform in Scalability**

Terraform enhances scalability by enabling infrastructure automation and consistency. Key benefits include:

1. **Effortless Resource Provisioning**  
   Terraform's declarative configuration makes it easy to define and deploy scalable AWS services. For example, provisioning DynamoDB with auto-scaling and Lambda functions with adequate memory allocation is as simple as updating the configuration files.

2. **Version Control and Collaboration**  
   With Terraform, infrastructure is treated as code, which means you can version, review, and collaborate on changes. This ensures that scaling configurations are managed and deployed systematically.

3. **Environment Replication**  
   Terraform makes it easy to replicate environments for testing or disaster recovery. You can scale horizontally by provisioning additional environments with identical configurations, ensuring consistency across deployments.

4. **Simplified Updates and Scaling Adjustments**  
   When scaling requirements change, Terraform allows you to modify the configuration files and apply updates with minimal downtime. For instance, increasing DynamoDB's provisioned capacity or adding new Lambda triggers can be automated through a single command.

5. **Cost Management**  
   Terraform helps optimize scalability-related costs by providing fine-grained control over resource configurations. It integrates with AWS Cost Explorer and other tools to ensure that scaling aligns with budgetary goals.

---

By combining AWS's robust scalability features with Terraform's IaC automation, this IoT system ensures that it can handle growing demands efficiently, maintain high availability, and optimize resource usage for cost-effectiveness. This architecture is well-suited for both current needs and future expansions, making it an ideal choice for production IoT systems.
